# whatever you can do in CSS you can achieve it in js

# using document.write() will delete all the existing HTML

# js statements are composed of:
#  values, operators , expressions , keywords and comments

# spaces do not matter in JS

# in programming there are things youll always do  is :
# creating data, modifying data , display data, storing data , transfer data 

# the two types of values are : fixed variable (number literals and string literals) and variable values(variables eg. let y)

# an expresion is a mix of values, variables and operators
